# What is this ?
This is a fork of the beautiful @jez9999 's vsclassic-icon-theme.

## Visual Studio classic icons theme
This Visual Studio Code icons theme takes its inspiration from classic versions of Visual Studio prior to 2012.  Icons for files tend to be colourful and distinctive.  Wherever possible, the original Visual Studio icon is used for a file type, but sometimes icons need to be modified or newly created for newer file types that were not given a special icon by Visual Studio versions prior to 2012.

## I don't see the icon for my favorite language here! What do I do?
You can contribute your own icons! If you want to know how, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/o-dka/vsclassic-icon-theme/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
