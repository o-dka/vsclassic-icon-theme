# Visual Studio classic icons theme

This Visual Studio Code icons theme takes its inspiration from classic versions of Visual Studio prior to 2012.  Icons for files tend to be colourful and distinctive.  Where possible, the direct Visual Studio icon is used for a file type, but occasionally they need to be modified or created for newer file types that were not given a special icon by Visual Studio versions prior to 2012.

# Future changes

I'm open to changes and additions for this theme's icons.  If you have any suggestions or contributions, please feel free to submit a new Issue or Pull request!
