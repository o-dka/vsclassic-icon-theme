# What is this ?
This is a fork of  beautiful @jez9999 's vsclassic-icon-theme.

## Visual Studio classic icons theme
This Visual Studio Code icons theme takes its inspiration from classic versions of Visual Studio prior to 2012.  Icons for files tend to be colourful and distinctive.  Where possible, the direct Visual Studio icon is used for a file type, but occasionally they need to be modified or created for newer file types that were not given a special icon by Visual Studio versions prior to 2012.

## I don't see the icon for my favourite language here! What do I do?
You can contribute your own icons here! If you want to know how, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/o-dka/vsclassic-icon-theme/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  in our github repository!
